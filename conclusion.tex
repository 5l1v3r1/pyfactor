From what have seen factoring is hard to do. Unfortunately our best realistic algorithm (GNFS) is too slow to factor numbers in an acceptable time frame. Shor's algorithm is not feasible because there are a lot of hurdles to building a computer that could run the algorithm. What this all means is that factoring is not easily doable, leaving modern computer security intact. GNFS is so inefficient that changing 1000 bit keys even annually is enough to keep your system secure. Additionally, these algorithms work only on non even numbers that are not power of primes. Those things also happen to be part of the restrictions set on cryptographic numbers, so these work perfectly on such factoring problems. There are algorithms that work on even or power of prime numbers. Those are algorithms like AKS or Miller Rabin. Those algorithms are designed for primality testing (is $s$ a prime?) which happens to be polynomial time. Those algorithms can also tell you what the factors of these specific types of numbers are, so those special cases of factoring fall into polynomial time. Although factoring may ultimately not be completely secure, it is proving at the least to be hard enough to tide us over until a new breakthrough is made. If it is cracked, it will also be beneficial in other tasks such as the Fourier transform mentioned in the applications section above.
